# Express with TypeScript Architecture

The main goal of this project is to provide a structured architecture on how to create an (API-only) Express.JS application. What it isn't, is a production-ready boilerplate for you to use, it's meant to guide you to create your own boilerplate and teach you a way to structure your code. Express.JS is unopinated and as such is this REPO.

This project demonstrates a controllers, services, middlewares, and DAO data architecture. There are many different software patterns that could be used, but I found this most useful for a simple but maintainable API application using Express.JS.
